# HM_Recommender_System

In this competition project, we developed product recommendations based on data from previous transactions, as well as from customer and product meta data. The available meta data spans from simple data, such as garment type and customer age, to text data from product descriptions, to image data from garment images. We built a Deep Learning-based Ensemble Fashion Recommender System using Recbole to predict future purchases based on customer order history. Ensemble models include - BERT4Rec, FDSA, RepeatNET, LightSAN, and GRU4RecF.
